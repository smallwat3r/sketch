# Sketch

I always keep a blank file open in a corner of my window in case I need to quickly note or copy something for later. But I spend most of my time in my terminal and I've decided to build a simple bash script that will help me save time.

Sketch is a small productivity script to rapidly generate and access draft files from a unique folder directly from the terminal.  

![Alt Text](https://github.com/smallwat3r/sketch/blob/master/demo/demo.gif)  
_in this demo `sketch` is aliased to `s`_

## Set up
Clone this repository and run the following commands.  
```sh
make install
```
OR  
```sh
cp src/sketch /usr/local/bin/sketch && chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/sketch
```

You can now run sketch by typing `sketch` in your terminal.  

A nice thing is to alias Sketch to a shortcut to run it even faster from the terminal. 
I personaly use `s`. You will need to close and reopen your terminal so the change can apply. 
```sh
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
alias s="sketch"
```

In `~/.sketchconfig` you can enter your favourite text editor (ex: `vim`, `nano`, `subl` ...), note that `vim` is set-up as default.  
You can also chose the folder location from where your sketch files are archived.  

## Usage

```
sketch            automatically open a new draft file from the 
                  sketch directory.

Optional Arguments
------------------------------------------------------------

-h, --help        show this help message and exit.
-l<number>        open archived saved files. Example: -l1 will
                  open the last sketch file saved, -l2 will open
                  the previous one, etc.
-pu, --purge      purge all the files archived in set-up temp dir.
-v, --version     sketch version.
```

---

Sketch is archiving the saved draft files under a default dir at  `$HOME/.local/share/sketch_dir` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/sketch_dir` (if `sketch_dir` not specified in `.sketchconfig`), all the files are named as `<incremental_integer>.sketch`
