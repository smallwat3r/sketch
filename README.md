# Sketch

I always kept a blank file open in a corner of my screen in case I need to quickly note or copy something for later. This simple bash script helps me save time to create / reopen my draft notes.

Sketch is a small productivity tool to generate and access / store draft files directly from the terminal.

Sketch works with all text editor that can be triggered from a terminal command (vim, nvim, macvim, nano, subl etc...).

## Customization

#### .sketchrc file

The sketchrc file allows you to use your preferred editor.  

```sh
# .sketchrc file directory location by priority order.
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.sketchrc
$HOME/.config/.sketchrc
$HOME/.sketchrc
```

* **SKETCH_EDITOR**: sketch default editor, if not set, check for `$EDITOR` if global env vars, if not set, default to vim.
* **SKETCH_ARCHIVES**: archived files folder from where your sketch files will be archived. 

```sh
# .sketchrc example file.

# Your favourite editor to use Sketch (vim, nvim, subl, emacs, nano etc)
SKETCH_EDITOR=vim

# Archives folder.
# Default locations:
#     - $XDG_DATA_HOME/sketch_archives
#     - $HOME/.local/share/sketch_archives 
SKETCH_ARCHIVES=$HOME/.sketch_archives 
```

#### Archived files

Each time a sketch file is created and saved, it is archived under a specific directory.
```sh
# Sketch file directory location by priority order (if $SKETCH_ARCHIVES not set).
$XDG_DATA_HOME/sketch_archives
$HOME/.local/share/sketch_archives 
```
Archived files naming convention: `<int>.sketch`.
